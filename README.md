## Development

PolarPrint is written in Golang and handlebars.
It's recommended that you are familiar with Golang if you wish to work on the backend, and required that you have it installed.
See the install [offical install guide](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Once you are setup with golang, run the following to install the dependencies

```shell
go mod tidy
```

For easier development we recommend air to reload the program once you change something.

```bash
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
air
```
